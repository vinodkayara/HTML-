    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, was first introduced in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN, to help researchers share documents over the internet. The first version of HTML was very basic, containing only a small number of tags for formatting text and adding simple structure to web documents. In 1995, HTML 2.0 was released and standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). </p>

    <h2>History of HTML</h2>
<p>By 1997, HTML was taken over by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which released HTML 3.2. This version added features like tables, scripting (JavaScript), and support for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), making websites more dynamic and styled. Two years later, in 1999, HTML 4.01 was introduced with a focus on separating content from design. It offered different document types such as Strict, Transitional, and Frameset, and laid the foundation for accessibility and semantic structure.

In 2008, &nbsp work on HTML5 began as a collaboration between W3C and WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). HTML5 brought a major transformation, introducing modern features such as video, audio, canvas, and semantic tags like article and section. It improved support for mobile devices, multimedia, and interactive applications. Today, HTML5 is the backbone of modern web development, enabling developers to build rich, responsive, and accessible web applications.</p>
