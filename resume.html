	<dt>•	Saffron Quality Analysis using Image-Based Feature Extraction and Random Forest Classification <dt>
		<dd>This project automates saffron quality grading using image processing and machine learning, extracting key features        to classify saffron into grades A, AA, AAA, and AAAA. A Random Forest classifier ensures accuracy, while a StreamLit-based UI, chatbot for agricultural queries, and MySQL database enhance usability. A feedback loop refines classification, making it a scalable solution for farmers and traders.
